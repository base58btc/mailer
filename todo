notes on email templating:
- GMail has character limits
- use inline styles as much as possible
- Yahoo no use background images (use just a color declaration just the color)
- thunderbird doesn't load external images (have color in same declaration)
- could be a different color, need back-up color
- images won't load in a lot of clients (use alt text!)
- don't support flex and grid layouts
- inline imgs w/ uri encoded??
